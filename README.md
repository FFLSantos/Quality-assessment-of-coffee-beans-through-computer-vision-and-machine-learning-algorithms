# Quality assessment of coffee beans through computer vision and machine learning algorithms

This repository contains codes in both python and R to process digital images of coffee beans and extract geometric features that allow quality assessment, such as area, perimeter, and color features; and to classify coffee beans based on the extracted features through different machine learning algorithms, such as Deep Neural Network, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.
